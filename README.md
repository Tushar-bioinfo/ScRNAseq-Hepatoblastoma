# Single-Nucleus-RNA-Seq-Analysis-of-Hepatoblastoma-Tumors
This repository contains the code, data processing pipeline, and visualizations for a single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) study of hepatoblastoma.The dataset includes nuclei from patient tumor tissues, background liver, and patient-derived xenografts (PDX). The project replicates and extends analyses from the hepatoblastoma study published in Nature Cancer (PMID: 34497364).

Key Steps:
Preprocessing and quality control of snRNA-seq data using Seurat.

Batch correction and clustering with Harmony, yielding 10 distinct clusters (C0â€“C9).

Manual annotation of clusters based on canonical marker genes using GeneCards and literature references.

Differential expression analysis between tumor and PDX cells in specific clusters (e.g., fetal-like hepatoblastoma subpopulations).

Visualization of gene expression (e.g., AFP, CFH) and cell-type distributions.

Quantification of immune infiltration (e.g., T cell proportions) across sample types.

Tools & Packages:
Seurat, Harmony, ggplot2, dplyr

Feature plots, violin plots, volcano plots, and cell composition bar plots

Goals:
Characterize intratumoral heterogeneity and fetal-like expression patterns

Compare tumor vs PDX gene expression profiles
